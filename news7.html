                            <p>
                                Since the introduction of official Premier League squad numbers in the 1993/94 season, the attachment of fans to certain numbers has been unmistakeable. It’s not just numbers one to 11, either: Arsenal fans will have the same attachment to Thierry Henry’s 14 as Manchester United fans have to Eric Cantona’s 7, while the fact that Alan Shearer would have surely been an iconic number nine in any shirt number era didn’t change the fact that he made the number nine shirt his own at Newcastle when he had a freer choice.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Liverpool might not have enjoyed the same continuity in terms of trophies as the Premier League era was ushered in, but one thing remained the same: The numbers 7 and 9 remained iconic, be it Steve McManaman and Luis Suárez in the former, or Fernando Torres taking the nine shirt once worn by Robbie Fowler and Ian Rush in the early Premier League years (let’s not dwell on that 2011-2016 run). There’s one curious outlier, though, and it’s not entirely unique to the Reds. Until the arrival of Mohamed Salah in 2017, and that breathtaking first season, the number 11 shirt at Anfield felt like a bit of an afterthought. For almost every number 11 at Anfield over the space of 25 years, the number 11 was a consolation prize.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Jamie Redknapp wore it for a couple of years, but he only inherited it from squad player Mark Walters once injuries had begun to limit his action and only once managed a 25-game season wearing the number. Vladimir Šmicer was wearing 11 when he scored his important goal in the 2005 Champions League final, but he only accepted that shirt under duress when Harry Kewell took his favoured 7. Similarly, Robbie Fowler wasn’t able to take the 9 off Djibril Cissé’s back when he returned in January 2006, so six months with 11 it was. Even Roberto Firmino, handed 11 when he joined from Hoffenheim towards the end of Brendan Rodgers’ tenure, switched to 9 at the earliest opportunity.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Salah is different, though. He’s the closest Liverpool have to a global phenomenon, in the sense of having visibility among people who wouldn’t self-identify as football fans. And all of this without having one of the ‘sexier’ squad numbers. You might think I’m reading too much into this; that the profile of a player should be enough to override the power of any number on the back of their shirt, but we’ve repeatedly seen this is not the case. At the peak of his powers in 1998, Brazil striker Ronaldo launched the R9 Mercurial boot with Nike, carrying the tagline “Ultralight, so your legs can be as fast as your imagination”. There was no need to attempt to cut through the marketing speak, though, as the succinct ‘R9’ branding was, for many, more powerful than any sentence that surrounded it. A few years later, Ronaldo’s compatriot Ronaldinho had the ‘10R’ Nike Tiempo boots dedicated to him. As with his predecessor, the numbers carried more than just an association with the individuals: while the number nine was the true star of the show, the uncatchable striker who was the main difference maker, 10 was reserved for the creator who made things happen and set the tempo (or in Dinho’s case, the Tiempo).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As superclubs have become more top-heavy on the pitch, the value of the number seven for forwards has grown, often for those who began life as wingers. This power was best emphasised through Cristiano Ronaldo, who pushed to complete his 2018 move from Real Madrid to Juventus on the seventh day of the seventh month, even if it was officially completed a little later. The number 11, though? It’s always felt a little excluded from the narrative. Even at Manchester United, where they had two exciting wide midfielders within the space of a few years, David Beckham’s seven found itself associated with a far more visible player-as-brand than Ryan Giggs’ eleven. Beckham even went on to use ‘seven’ as a middle name for his daughter.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                And yet at Anfield, it’s the opposite to what you might expect. Sadio Mané is another exceptional talent, another player with a huge African fanbase and another practising Muslim with a big profile in sport. One might expect the number 10 to tip things in the Senegalese’s favour, but instead it’s Salah who finds himself as more of a worldwide ‘face’. When you’re a kid kicking a football around the back garden, you don’t dream of being a number 11. The nines and tens are the traditional superstars, those whose number you want on the back of your replica shirt, and you might accept 11 on your school football kit at a push.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Perhaps it’s Salah’s unorthodox route to superstardom, however, that makes him such a good fit. He didn’t even wear 11 for the first few years of his European career, making do with 22 at Basel, 15 at Chelsea, and – during his loan at Fiorentina – the number 74 shirt in honour of the 74 people killed at the Port Said Stadium in Egypt in 2012. The number 11 appears to have given him power as much as he has brought it out of the shade, adorning his back as he has developed into a worldwide star at Roma and then Liverpool.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Part of his relatability comes from this path; this refusal to give up when his big move to Chelsea fell flat and his belief that he could still rise to the summit.Perhaps that’s the way we should look at this, then. Certain numbers belong to those who have protagonist status imparted on them from the very beginning, while others can be looked at as an invitation to give up on that dream. In Salah’s case, though, he looked at the message being put out and decided he should be the one to rewrite it.
